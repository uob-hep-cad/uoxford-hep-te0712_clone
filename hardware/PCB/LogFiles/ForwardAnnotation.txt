     The PDBs listed in the project file will be searched to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the iCDB and to replace any duplicates found in the
      Target PDB.

     The schematic source is a Common Data Base.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted

     The packaging of all prepackaged schematic symbols is consistent
      with the Parts DataBase data for the cross mapping of
