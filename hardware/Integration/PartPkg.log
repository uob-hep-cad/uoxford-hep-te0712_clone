         Unable to determine the Disable Repackage status.
         !Repackaging will be allowed!

         The PDBs listed in the project file will be searched to satisfy the parts
          requirements of the iCDB and to replace any duplicates found in the
          Target PDB.

         The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
          designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
          and the relevant symbols repackaged.

         The cross mapping of symbol pin names to Part Number pin
          numbers will be checked for packaged symbols and mapped correctly
          for unpackaged symbols.

         Properties that have been checked off in the Property Definition Editor
          found at Library Manager/Common Properties will be checked for value
          differences between the PartsDB and the non-null properties on symbols.
         Those properties checked off (other than Part Number)
          will not be transferred from the PartsDB to symbols.

     Checking for value differences between non-null symbol properties and PartsDB properties,
      but only for those properties checked off in the Property Definition Editor

     Checking the validity of the packaging of prepackaged schematic
      symbols.  Only the first error in symbols having the same
      Reference Designator will be reported.

     The packaging of all prepackaged schematic symbols is consistent
      with the Parts DataBase data for the cross mapping of
      symbol pin names to Part Number pin numbers.
      Symbols that were not prepackaged will now be packaged correctly.
      
     No errors in Existing Schematic Packaging.

     The Common DataBase has been read and will be packaged.
